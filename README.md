INTENTIONS ( Goals ):
Software dev skillset:
Build a CRUD app with a GO backend & a vanilla JS frontend. 
 - Ideally I would like to focus on building with what is available in a given language.
 - This should give me an idea of how GO works. Plus its good for me to work with VanillaJS

Business:
Get current MVPs out to market before the end of the year.
